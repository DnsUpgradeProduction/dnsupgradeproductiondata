Since it is not possible to capture the entire spectrum of all cultural and media institutions, the indicator is limited to publicly funded institutions in the areas of theaters, concert halls and orchestras, libraries, archives, museums and art galleries, visitor centers, music clubs, festivals, event venues, and publicly accessible cultural heritage sites. Cultural education institutions such as music schools are not included.<br><br>Given the heterogeneity of the cultural and media landscape, the indicator focuses on certificates and management systems that cover various aspects of sustainability. These include, among others, the German Sustainability Code (DNK), \u00d6koprofit, the Economy for the Common Good, KlimaBilanzKultur (KBK) and KlimaBilanzKultur+&nbsp;(KBK+), the Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (<abbr title=\"Eco-Management and Audit Scheme\" tabindex=\"0\">EMAS</abbr>), and the application of the following management systems: <abbr title=\"International Organization for Standardization\" tabindex=\"0\">ISO</abbr> 14001&nbsp;(international environmental management system standard), <abbr title=\"International Organization for Standardization\" tabindex=\"0\">ISO</abbr> 20121-24&nbsp;(sustainability management systems for events), <abbr title=\"International Organization for Standardization\" tabindex=\"0\">ISO</abbr> 50001&nbsp;(international energy management standard), and <abbr title=\"International Organization for Standardization\" tabindex=\"0\">ISO</abbr> 50005&nbsp;(guidelines for the phased introduction of energy management systems).<br><br>Cultural and media institutions that meet at least one of these certificates or management systems are grouped together. Due to the large number of certificates and management systems, there may be overlaps with other indicators of the German Sustainability Strategy (<abbr title=\"German Susatinability Strategy\" tabindex=\"0\">DNS</abbr>), such as the voluntary sustainability reporting of companies according to the German Sustainability Code (DNK) (<a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/8-6\">Indicator 8.6</a>) and the number of <abbr title=\"Eco-Management and Audit Scheme\" tabindex=\"0\">EMAS</abbr>-certified companies (<a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/12-2-a\">Indicator 12.2.a</a>).<br><br>The unweighted summation across cultural and media institutions, which are very heterogeneous in terms of both size and focus, and which have committed to certificates and management systems with different orientations, limits the indicator\"s significance regarding the social and ecological orientation of cultural production. At most, the indicator allows for a future assessment of whether the commitment of cultural and media institutions to sustainability issues is increasing in general. Furthermore, the reference to a certificate or management system only provides indirect information about the actual extent of the ecological and social impact of the cultural sector.<br><br>The certificates and management systems considered largely do not explicitly refer to the cultural sector, but rather address general aspects of sustainable business and production. The indicator does not consider the protection of culture or the sustainable use of cultural content, but rather highlights the sustainability aspects of cultural institutions. A special communicative function of culture, which is intended to contribute to social awareness in various socio-cultural environments, is only indirectly taken into account by the indicator, as the certifications mentioned do not focus on the content of cultural products, but rather on their production and provision. Nor can it necessarily be concluded that the target groups of cultural institutions are actually influenced in their actions by their sustainable orientation. Rather, a sustainable cultural offering could increasingly appeal to an environment that is already sensitized to the respective issues.<br><br>In 2024, 77&nbsp;cultural and media institutions were recorded with at least one sustainability certificate. The exact total number of publicly funded cultural and media institutions in Germany is unknown, but there are almost 9,000&nbsp;libraries, over 6,000&nbsp;museums, and more than 600&nbsp;public theater venues. This illustrates that the absolute number of sustainability-certified cultural and media institutions is in the per mille range, indicating considerable potential for growth in this area.<br><br>For various reasons, audiovisualproducts are not included in the indicator. Environmental standards exist for the production of German cinema, TV, and online/video on demand productions, covering aspects such as energy consumption, transport, accommodation and catering, as well as the use and utilization of materials. Since March 1, 2023, compliance with these standards has been mandatory in order to receive federal funding. In the first six months after the introduction of mandatory compliance, a total of 82&nbsp;audiovisual productions demonstrated compliance. A further 234&nbsp;productions followed between September 1, 2023, and August 30, 2024.<br><br>Data collection did not begin until 2024, so it is not yet possible to assess the indicator in relation to the politically defined goal of increasing the number of sustainability-certified cultural and media institutions.</p>","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"<a href=\"https://www.deutscher-nachhaltigkeitskodex.de/en/\" target=\"_blank\" onclick=\"return confirm_alert('the German Sustainability Code', 'En')\">German Sustainability Code</a>","source_organisation_1_short":"<a href=\"https://www.deutscher-nachhaltigkeitskodex.de/en/\" target=\"_blank\" onclick=\"return confirm_alert('the German Sustainability Code', 'En')\">German Sustainability Code</a>","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.deutscher-nachhaltigkeitskodex.de/en/\" target=\"_blank\" onclick=\"return confirm_alert('the German Sustainability Code', 'En')\"><img src=\"https://dnsTestEnvironment.github.io/dns-indicators/public/OrgImgEn/dnk.png\" alt=\"German Sustainability Code\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationGerman Sustainability Code\" style=\"height:60px;
