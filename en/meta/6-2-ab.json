They capture the number of people reached through <abbr title=\"Reconstruction Loan Corporation\" tabindex=\"0\">KfW</abbr>-funded projects, provided these are mandated by German federal ministries. Projects implemented by <abbr title=\"Reconstruction Loan Corporation\" tabindex=\"0\">KfW</abbr> on behalf of, and with funding from, the European Union (<abbr title=\"European Union\" tabindex=\"0\">EU</abbr>) or other donor countries are excluded, as are projects carried out by other actors such as the Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (<abbr title=\"German Agency for International Cooperation\" tabindex=\"0\">GIZ</abbr>) <abbr title=\"Company with limited liability\" tabindex=\"0\">GmbH</abbr>, the German federal states, or private organisations.<br><br>Both indicators refer exclusively to the planned figures for new financing commitments (grant and loan agreements) for drinking water and sanitation projects at the time the contract is signed between <abbr title=\"Reconstruction Loan Corporation\" tabindex=\"0\">KfW</abbr> and the respective partner country. <abbr title=\"Reconstruction Loan Corporation\" tabindex=\"0\">KfW</abbr> estimates how many people, upon completion of the construction works, are expected to benefit from new or improved access to drinking water and sanitation. Whether these people are actually reached can only be reliably determined after the infrastructure is operational and is therefore not captured by the indicators.<br><br>As an individual can gain both new or improved access to drinking water and to sanitation, double counting between the two indicators, as well as over time, is possible. The funds committed by <abbr title=\"Reconstruction Loan Corporation\" tabindex=\"0\">KfW</abbr> consist of grants and loans financed either from the federal budget or raised on the capital market. The recipients are typically developing and emerging countries, creating a link to Indicator 17.1&nbsp;\"Official development assistance as a proportion of gross national income\".<br><br>In 2019, the methodology and data basis of the indicators were revised. Until then, both directly reached people&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;for example, through a household connection&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;and indirectly reached people&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;such as the total population of a country supported through a sector reform programme&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;were counted. Since the revision, only directly reached people have been included. To illustrate the ratio between directly and indirectly reached people: in 2017, a total of 28.6&nbsp;million people were reached, of whom 19.1&nbsp;million were direct beneficiaries. In 2018, there were 15.2&nbsp;million direct beneficiaries out of a total of 60.3&nbsp;million people reached.<br><br>Another methodological change concerns the inclusion of beneficiaries in multilateral projects: since the revision, their number has been counted proportionally according to the German financial share in the overall measure.<br><br>Until 2018, <abbr title=\"Reconstruction Loan Corporation\" tabindex=\"0\">KfW</abbr>\u2019s planned figures for the number of people to be provided with access to drinking water and sanitation with German support consistently exceeded the politically defined target of 10&nbsp;million people per year. With the introduction of the revised methodology, the target for new or improved access to drinking water was set at 6&nbsp;million people annually. In 2023, the planned figure was 10.2&nbsp;million people&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;significantly exceeding the target, as in each of the four preceding years.<br><br>Since 2019, the target for the number of people with new or improved access to basic sanitation or wastewater treatment has been 4&nbsp;million people per year. This target has only been exceeded in 2019&nbsp;and 2022.
