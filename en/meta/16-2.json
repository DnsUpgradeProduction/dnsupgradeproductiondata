Inadequate security measures regarding small arms and ammunition can lead to an escalation of conflicts and the illicit proliferation of weapons. The Bundeswehr contributes to this effort as part of its security policy responsibility by deploying experts in this field to train personnel in various regions of the world to strengthen small arms control and ammunition security.<br><br>This indicator represents the total number of people trained by the Bundeswehr in the areas of small arms control and ammunition security since 2024. The data is based on a special evaluation by the Bundeswehr Center for Verification Tasks.<br><br>The training covers topics such as storage security, weapons identification, ammunition transport, and documentation. A distinction is made between training in small arms control (identification, documentation, and registration) and training in storage and ammunition security (Physical Security and Stockpile Management, PSSM). The latter focuses on the safe storage and transport of ammunition and explosives, as well as on security precautions for ammunition depots, including their distances from civilian buildings. The various training courses last between a few days and several weeks. Approximately five to ten courses are conducted annually. Each course trains approximately 15&nbsp;to 60&nbsp;participants. The regional priorities are determined annually in consultation with the Federal Foreign Office. The current focus is on Southeast Europe, including Ukraine, West Africa, particularly the ECOWAS (Economic Community of West African States) region, and Central Asia.<br><br>In 2024, 182&nbsp;specialists were trained, including 33&nbsp;women and 149&nbsp;men. The politically defined goal is to train a total of at least 1,000&nbsp;people in this field between the beginning of 2024&nbsp;and the end of 2030. The required annual volume of training measures was reached in the first survey in 2024.<br><br>All trained individuals are considered equal in the indicator, regardless of the duration and intensity of the training, which somewhat limits its significance. Furthermore, no qualitative conclusions can be drawn from the indicator regarding the type of training or the subsequent practical application of the skills taught. Revision in the form of subsequent or ongoing monitoring of the content taught\u2014if carried out\u2014is not part of the indicator. Nor can it be determined to what extent or to what extent the trained individuals subsequently actually contribute to preventing the illegal proliferation of weapons.</p>","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"<a href=\"https://www.bmvg.de/de\" target=\"_blank\" onclick=\"return confirm_alert('the Federal Ministry of Defence', 'En')\">Federal Ministry of Defence</a>","source_organisation_1_short":"<a href=\"https://www.bmvg.de/de\" target=\"_blank\" onclick=\"return confirm_alert('the Federal Ministry of Defence', 'En')\">Federal Ministry of Defence</a>","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.bmvg.de/de\" target=\"_blank\" onclick=\"return confirm_alert('the Federal Ministry of Defence', 'En')\"><img src=\"https://dnsTestEnvironment.github.io/dns-indicators/public/OrgImgEn/bmvg.png\" alt=\"Federal Ministry of Defence\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationFederal Ministry of Defence\" style=\"height:60px; width:148px; border:transparent\"/></a>","source_url_1":"https://www.bmvg.de/de/themen/friedenssicherung/ruestungskontrolle/kontrolle-der-kleinwaffen-und-des-waffenhandels","source_url_text_1":"Control of small arms and the arms trade","source_url_alert_1":"the Federal Ministry of Defence","weather_active_1":true,"weather_indicator_1":"16.2 Von der Bundeswehr ausgebildetes Personal zur St\u00e4rkung der Kleinwaffenkontrolle und Munitionssicherheit","weather_indicator_1_year_a":2024,"weather_indicator_1_target":"Von 2025&nbsp;bis 2030&nbsp;Ausbildung von mindestens 1&nbsp;000&nbsp;Personen durch Expertinnen und Experten der Bundeswehr","weather_indicator_1_target_1":"Von 2024&nbsp;bis 2030&nbsp;Ausbildung von mindestens 1000&nbsp;Personen durch Expertinnen und Experten der Bundeswehr","weather_indicator_1_target_1_category":"normal","weather_indicator_1_target_1_targetYear":2030,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_a":"Keine","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_a_title":"Keine Bewertung m\u00f6glich.","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_a_valid":true,"graph_target_points":[{"type":"box","xMin":2.694,"xMax":3.306,"yMin":0,"yMax":1000,"borderColor":"#00689d","backgroundColor":"transparent","borderDash":[1,0],"borderWidth":2,"preset":"target_points"},{"type":"label","xValue":3,"yValue":850.0,"backgroundColor":"transparent","content":["Ziel: ","1 000"],"font":{"size":14},"borderColor":"transparent"}],"data_show_map":false,"copyright":"&copy; Federal Statistical Office (Destatis), 2025","data_footnote":"The data is based on a special evaluation and is not publicly accessible.","graph_title":"Personnel trained by the Bundeswehr to strengthen small arms control and ammunition security","graph_annotations":[{"value":1000,"label":{"content":"Target 2030","position":"left","backgroundColor":"transparent","color":"transparent"},"preset":"target_line","borderColor":"transparent"}],"span_gaps":true,"show_line":true,"graph_type":"bar","data_start_values":[{"field":"Time series","value":"Trained personnel for small arms control"}],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"Sex","rating":"","target_description":"The number of people trained by experts from the Bundeswehr is to increase to a total of 1,000&nbsp;between 2024&nbsp;and 2030.<br><br><br>No assessment possible.
