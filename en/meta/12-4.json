It is intended to serve as an analysis of the extent to which they rely on credit to finance their consumption and economic activities. The data for the calculation come from the financial accounts of the Deutsche Bundesbank.<br><br>From a financial perspective, private households are primarily characterized by the fact that they use financial expenditures primarily for the consumption of goods and services. Unlike the national accounts<sup>1</sup>, the Bundesbank also includes sole proprietors, freelancers, and self-employed farmers in this sector. Non-profit institutions serving households<sup>2</sup> include organizations with their own legal personality that, as private, non-market-producing units, provide private households with various services, such as political parties, trade unions, religious institutions, foundations, and social associations.<br><br>The debt captured by the indicator consists primarily of consumer credit, loans, and other financial obligations oriented towards consumption. Commercial loans are also considered as part of private debt. Housing loans are not included.<br><br>By examining consumer debt in relation to <abbr title=\"Gross domestic product\" tabindex=\"0\">GDP</abbr>, the indicator does not allow for detailed conclusions about the debt situation of individual households or its distribution. It merely represents the ratio of total consumer debt to economic output, without taking into account the distribution of debt within the population or individual debt sustainability. A comprehensive analysis of over-indebtedness would require examining private household debt in relation to variables such as disposable household income. Such an approach would include both the absolute level of debt and the ability of households to service their debts in line with their income.<br><br>In contrast to consumer loans, housing loans theoretically offer the possibility of selling the purchased property at any time if necessary and potentially offsetting the debt burden associated with the loan through the sale of the property. In practice, however, the value retention of real estate is often difficult to predict, so that even taking out housing loans can lead to over-indebtedness.<br><br>The indicator shows a decline in the ratio of consumer debt to <abbr title=\"Gross domestic product\" tabindex=\"0\">GDP</abbr> from 15.9% in 2014&nbsp;to 11.7% in 2023. The absolute amount of debt rose from approximately 465&nbsp;billion euros to around 488&nbsp;billion euros over the same period, corresponding to an increase of 5%. The decline in the share of consumer debt in <abbr title=\"Gross domestic product\" tabindex=\"0\">GDP</abbr> is mainly due to the stronger growth in economic output compared to the growth of consumer debt. The year 2020&nbsp;is an exception: In the first year of the <abbr title=\"Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2\" tabindex=\"0\">COVID-19</abbr>&nbsp;pandemic, <abbr title=\"Gross domestic product\" tabindex=\"0\">GDP</abbr> declined, causing the indicator value to rise briefly. The total amount of loans also fell in 2020&nbsp;and 2021. In 2022, the total amount of loans rose again. In 2022&nbsp;and 2023, the European Central Bank (<abbr title=\"European Central Bank\" tabindex=\"0\">ECB</abbr>) gradually increased its key interest rate. Total loans in 2023&nbsp;were at their lowest level since 2018, at around 488&nbsp;billion euros. In general, it can be stated that the indicator\"s development in the past has mainly depended on <abbr title=\"Gross domestic product\" tabindex=\"0\">GDP</abbr> trends, which overall showed significantly greater changes than total consumer credit.<br><br>The politically defined goal of reducing consumer debt to below 10% of <abbr title=\"Gross domestic product\" tabindex=\"0\">GDP</abbr> by 2030&nbsp;is expected to be achieved if the trend of recent years continues.<br><br><small><sup>1</sup> Sector S.14&nbsp;of the European System of Accounts (<abbr title=\"European System of National and Regional Accounts\" tabindex=\"0\">ESA</abbr>).<br><br><sup>2</sup> Sector S.15&nbsp;of the European System of Accounts (<abbr title=\"European System of National and Regional Accounts\" tabindex=\"0\">ESA</abbr>).</small></p>","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"<a href=\"https://www.bundesbank.de/en\" target=\"_blank\" onclick=\"return confirm_alert('the German Federal Bank', 'En')\">German Federal Bank</a>","source_organisation_1_short":"<a href=\"https://www.bundesbank.de/en\" target=\"_blank\" onclick=\"return confirm_alert('the German Federal Bank', 'En')\">German Federal Bank</a>","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.bundesbank.de/en\" target=\"_blank\" onclick=\"return confirm_alert('the German Federal Bank', 'En')\"><img src=\"https://dnsTestEnvironment.github.io/dns-indicators/public/OrgImgEn/bundesbank.png\" alt=\"German Federal Bank\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationGerman Federal Bank\" style=\"height:60px;
